{% note %}

**Note:** {% data variables.product.company_short %} no longer supports required workflows for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. To require workflows to pass before merging, upgrade {% data variables.location.product_location %} to the latest version and use repository rulesets instead.

For more information about upgrading {% data variables.location.product_location %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/overview/about-upgrades-to-new-releases)."

For more information about repository rulesets, see "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-server@latest/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/available-rules-for-rulesets#require-workflows-to-pass-before-merging)."
